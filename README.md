# WaveFunctionVisualizer
This widget was created as a way to explore Python, particularly numpy, matplotlib and tkinter. It is an exploration of the classic 'particle in a box' problem most students encounter in their first semester of Quantum Mechanics or Physical Chemistry. Please feel free to contribute to my explanatory text and make suggestions on how to improve this code.

This was created while at Code Chrysalis.

## Installation
This program requires, NumPy, MatPlotLib and Tkinter. please use pip to install them. After that, run Main_Gui.py from the commandline. 

## Future Work and ToDos
Please check out todo.md for my next steps in improving the code. I would appreciate any Tkinter tips.
